Craftory
===

This is a lightweight theme framework based on Underscores, with a few additions inspired by Genesis and Jetpack. Changes from Underscores include:

* A _more_ helpful 404 template.
* A custom header implementation that uses CSS backgrounds instead of img tags.
* A menu template tag that creates a consistent appearance between custom menus and page menus.
* The theme includes its own copy of the Jetpack mobile detection class. If the Jetpack plugin is not enabled, the mobile functions are still available.
* Subpages shortcode with depth option.

The theme options page includes:

* layout choices
* per-post-type comment default settings
* subpage listings on empty pages
* Google verification code field

The Craftory framework is licensed under GPLv2.
