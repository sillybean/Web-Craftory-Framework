Craftory
===

This is a lightweight theme framework based on Underscores, with a few additions inspired by Genesis and Jetpack. Changes from Underscores include:

* A _more_ helpful 404 template that searches the site for the words entered in the bad URL.
* A custom header implementation that uses CSS backgrounds instead of img tags.
* A menu template tag that creates a consistent appearance between custom menus and page menus.
* Mobile detection and conditional tags. The theme includes its own copy of the Jetpack mobile detection class. If the Jetpack plugin is not enabled, the mobile functions are still available.
* Subpages shortcode with depth option.
* Customizer options:
** Footer text
* Theme options:
** layout choices
** per-post-type comment default settings
** subpage listings on empty pages
** Google verification code field
* Action hooks:
** Before and after main content
** Before and after heading
** Before and after footer
* Filters:
** Footer content
